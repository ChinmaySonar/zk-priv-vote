TASKS:

1. Decoupling proof generation and verification --> Rakshith

2. Do same functionalities with geth -- just put string in each transaction 
	-- create a network of at least two nodes and do the string thing.. test consenses and all --> Chinmay

3. Figure out the timing thing -- contestancy announcement (Setup phase), voting window (voting phase), proof verification window (counting and verification) -- how to do these things













###########################
SETUP:

	-- To handle t malicious agents we have at least 2t+1 honest agents in the system (Same as PBFT)
	-- Threshold of winning is set to t+1


#########################

MALICIOUS CASES:

1. Voter malicious

	i. Vote multiple times
		-- Consider the latest vote, in particular, compute N with the latest factors
		-- 

	ii. Encrypt incorrect factors
		i) repeated factors
 
	iii. Don't ecrypt factors -- all participants can see the factors 
		-- Think carefully that our protocol handle

	iv. Say "yes" to false proof
		-- Handled with honest majority
	v. Compute N incorrectly
		-- Votes is not discarding false proof -- handled by honest majority



2. Contestant malicious

	i. Compute N incorrectly and provide that proof
		-- Honest majority will discard the proof

	ii. Provide false proof
		-- Honest majority will discard the proof

  	(This case is mostly handled by honest majority)

3. Node failure

	-- Number of voters take care of this
