overall structure of the protocol

options in setting up blockchain



rsa signature to find the sender of a message on bc -- is there any cleaner way in web3 itself?

Assumption -- there's a way to get the sender for any block on blockchain

Assumption -- Malicious agents when sending non-encrypted factors follow a specified format

Assumption -- Malicious agent either sends both factors unencypted or none 
(case with one factor can be handled with little more core but is not interesting and I'm lazy)


1. exchange of public keys: Can we assume publickeys as identities and that we share those beforehand without sharing explicitly on the bc 
--> check transaction.from if that works we may be able to get rid of signatures

2. Miner -- i) Figure out if mining cna be started with python code  -- https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py/issues/778
            ii) If not, make phase I longer for safety

3. Add wait until block number before each phase
